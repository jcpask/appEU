            Data from European Union API (click <a href="https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/resource/pi4w-3vc9.json">here</a>)
        </i>.  This page shows data from funds granted from the European Union's Cohesion Policy.  The different member states receive funds from different sources, based on their needs.  This includes member states who are less developed, in transition, and developed.  It also includes whether a member state received funds to revitalize a rural area, or some other kind of area, and whether the area might be used for agriculture or some other enterprise.  You can think of it like a senior citizen who gets funds from social security, medicare, and a tax refund--all the money comes from the government, but from very different pots of money, for different purposes, and with different needs in mind.</p>
